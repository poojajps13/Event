        <p style="float: left;">A Centre of Excellence is set up by CBSE for enhancing the technical skills of students
            to design, visualize, and simulate their ideas before they are ever built or create. The center of
            excellence is realizing that design & analysis is emerging field and most of the industries are going
            towards this field. The labs are equipped with the latest software, which is being currently used in
            industries in designing and analysis of products. CSDA is focused on developing skills and concepts central
            to the successful use of the technology. Realizing that CSDA is emerging field and most of the industries
            are going towards CSDA, the department started the training program on design & analysis.</p>
