        <p style="float: left;">Engineers and scientists commonly use data acquisition hardware and software to automate
            the operation of processes and machinery without human interaction. Applications range from simple on/off
            actuator control to advanced closed-loop control with multiple inputs and outputs. The flexibility and
            productivity is provided by NI data acquisition (DAQ) hardware and LabVIEW software for PC-based control and
            automation. Manufacturing lines consist of numerous decoupled systems for automation, control, measurement,
            machine monitoring, and many other functions. Historically, these systems have stood alone – both from each
            other and from company enterprise networks. Each system performed its function in relative isolation –
            controlling the conveyor system, monitoring compressor bearing vibration, performing end-of-line electronics
            functional test, and so on. These hardware devices offer multifunction input and output for analog and
            discrete measurements along with a complete line of signal conditioning hardware necessary to acquire any
            signal from any sensor.</p>
        <h2 style="color: red;">Objective</h2>
        <p>To bridge the gap between Industry & academics through PC based instrumentation automation approach. To
            nurture skills among young engineering minds by establishing Innovation Centre is association with National
            Instruments INDIA.</p>
